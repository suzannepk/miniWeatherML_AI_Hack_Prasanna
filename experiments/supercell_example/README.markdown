Chatgpt 4o: What is Kessler Microphysics as pertains to climate? 

Kessler Microphysics is a simplified parameterization scheme used in numerical weather and climate models to simulate cloud and precipitation processes. It was introduced by Roger Kessler in 1969 as one of the earliest bulk microphysics schemes for atmospheric modeling.

Key Aspects of Kessler Microphysics in Climate and Weather Modeling:

Warm-Rain Process:
The scheme focuses on the warm-cloud microphysics, meaning it only includes liquid-phase processes (cloud droplets and raindrops) and excludes ice-phase processes (snow, graupel, hail).
It models the formation of rain through autoconversion, which is the process where cloud droplets coalesce and grow large enough to fall as rain.
Bulk Microphysics Approach:
Instead of tracking individual cloud droplets, the Kessler scheme treats cloud and rainwater as continuous variables (mass mixing ratios) and uses empirical relationships to govern their interactions.

Processes Included:

Cloud formation: Condensation of water vapor into cloud droplets.
Autoconversion: Transition from cloud droplets to raindrops when droplet concentration exceeds a threshold.

Accretion: Growth of raindrops by collecting smaller cloud droplets.

Evaporation: Rain droplets evaporate back into water vapor depending on temperature and humidity.

Application in Climate Models:
Used in early global climate models (GCMs) and regional weather models as a basic representation of cloud microphysics.
Still useful for idealized studies, process understanding, and computationally efficient simulations.
However, modern climate models often use more sophisticated schemes (e.g., Lin-Farley-Orville, Morrison, Thompson) that include mixed-phase and ice microphysics.

Limitations in Climate Applications:

No Ice Processes: Kessler microphysics cannot represent mixed-phase clouds or ice precipitation, which are critical in high-latitude and high-altitude climates.
Simplified Rain Formation: The autoconversion and accretion processes are based on empirical threshold-based functions, which may not capture real-world complexity.
Lack of Aerosol Interactions: Unlike more advanced schemes, it does not account for cloud-aerosol interactions, which are crucial for understanding climate change impacts on precipitation and cloud formation.

Why Itâ€™s Still Used:
Computationally efficient, making it suitable for idealized studies, simple weather models, and teaching cloud microphysics concepts.
Helps illustrate the fundamental behavior of cloud and rain formation in atmospheric models.

Azure o1-preview-HEAVY1 (version:2024-09-12) : What is Kessler Microphysics as pertains to climate? 

Kessler Microphysics refers to a simplified parameterization scheme used in atmospheric models to represent cloud and precipitation processes, particularly in the context of climate and weather simulations. Developed by meteorologist Edwin Kessler in the 1960s, the Kessler scheme provides a foundational framework for modeling the microphysical processes of warm (liquid-phase) clouds and precipitation without involving the complexities of ice-phase processes.

Context in Climate Modeling
 
In climate and numerical weather prediction models, accurately representing cloud microphysical processes is crucial because clouds play a significant role in Earth's energy balance and hydrological cycle. Microphysics schemes in these models simulate the formation, growth, and interaction of cloud particles and precipitation. However, resolving the detailed behavior of individual cloud droplets and raindrops (referred to as "spectral" or "bin" microphysics) is computationally intensive.

The Kessler Scheme
 
The Kessler Microphysics scheme is a bulk microphysics parameterization, meaning it simplifies the cloud and precipitation processes by grouping cloud particles into bulk categories based on their phase (e.g., cloud water, rainwater) and assumes an average behavior for each category. This reduces computational complexity while capturing the essential physics needed for large-scale models.

Key features and processes represented in the Kessler scheme include:

Condensation and Evaporation: The conversion between water vapor and cloud water based on saturation conditions in the atmosphere.

Autoconversion: The transformation of cloud water into rainwater when cloud droplets collide and coalesce enough to form raindrops. This process is often represented using a threshold for cloud water content above which autoconversion occurs.

Accretion: The growth of raindrops by collecting additional cloud water as they fall through the cloud.
Evaporation of Rain: The potential evaporation of falling raindrops when they descend into subsaturated air below the cloud base.
Importance and Limitations
 
The Kessler Microphysics scheme was one of the first attempts to include microphysical processes in atmospheric models and has been foundational in the development of more complex schemes. Its simplicity makes it computationally efficient and suitable for certain applications where detailed microphysics are less critical.

However, the Kessler scheme has limitations:

No Ice Processes: It does not account for ice-phase microphysics, such as the formation of snow, graupel, or hail, which are important in cooler cloud systems and high latitudes.

Simplified Microphysics: The scheme uses idealized representations of microphysical processes, which may not capture all the nuances of cloud behavior, especially in mixed-phase or deep 
convective clouds.

Threshold-Based Autoconversion: The use of fixed thresholds for processes like autoconversion can lead to abrupt transitions in the model output, which may not reflect the gradual nature of real atmospheric processes.
Modern Developments
 
In contemporary climate models, more sophisticated microphysics schemes have been developed to address the limitations of the Kessler scheme. These newer schemes include:
Mixed-Phase and Ice Microphysics: Incorporating additional hydrometeor categories such as cloud ice, snow, and graupel.
Spectral (Bin) Microphysics: Representing the size distribution of cloud particles and precipitation explicitly, allowing for more detailed interactions.
Double-Moment Schemes: Predicting both the mass and number concentration of hydrometeors, improving the representation of particle size distributions.
Conclusion
 
In summary, Kessler Microphysics is a fundamental scheme in atmospheric modeling that provides a simplified representation of warm cloud and precipitation processes. While it has been instrumental in advancing climate modeling, its simplifications necessitate the use of more advanced microphysics schemes for accurate simulations in modern climate research. Understanding the Kessler scheme is essential for grasping the evolution of microphysical parameterizations in atmospheric science.


Chatgpt4o: What are the equations associated with Kessler Microphysics? 

# Kessler Microphysics Equations in Climate Modeling

Kessler Microphysics is governed by a set of equations that describe the conversion of water vapor into cloud water, the formation of rain from cloud water, and the interaction between rain and the environment (e.g., evaporation).

---

## 1. Cloud Condensation (Water Vapor to Cloud Water)
Cloud water forms from the condensation of water vapor when the atmospheric humidity exceeds saturation. This process is governed by:

\[
\frac{d q_c}{d t} = \max(0, S - 1) \cdot C_c
\]

where:
- \( q_c \) = cloud water mixing ratio (kg/kg)
- \( S = \frac{q_v}{q_s} \) = saturation ratio (water vapor mixing ratio \( q_v \) divided by saturation mixing ratio \( q_s \))
- \( C_c \) = condensation rate coefficient (depends on supersaturation, temperature, and pressure)

If \( S > 1 \) (supersaturation), cloud water forms; if \( S < 1 \), no condensation occurs in this simple formulation.

---

## 2. Autoconversion (Cloud Water to Rainwater)
Once cloud droplets grow sufficiently large, they begin coalescing into raindrops through autoconversion. Kessler (1969) proposed a threshold-based equation for this:

\[
\frac{d q_r}{d t} = A_c (q_c - q_{c0}) \quad \text{for} \quad q_c > q_{c0}
\]

where:
- \( q_r \) = rainwater mixing ratio (kg/kg)
- \( A_c \) = autoconversion rate coefficient
- \( q_{c0} \) = critical cloud water threshold for raindrop formation (empirical constant)

Cloud water only converts to rain if \( q_c \) exceeds a critical value \( q_{c0} \), which represents the need for sufficient cloud droplet mass before raindrops can form.

---

## 3. Accretion (Cloud Water Merging with Rainwater)
Once rain has formed, it can continue growing by collecting additional cloud droplets in a process called accretion:

\[
\frac{d q_r}{d t} = A_a q_c q_r
\]

where:
- \( A_a \) = accretion coefficient (depends on droplet collection efficiency)
- \( q_c \) and \( q_r \) = cloud and rainwater mixing ratios

This term is proportional to both \( q_c \) and \( q_r \), meaning heavier rain grows more efficiently by sweeping up cloud droplets.

---

## 4. Rain Evaporation (Rainwater to Water Vapor)
Falling raindrops evaporate if they enter subsaturated air, reducing rain and increasing water vapor:

\[
\frac{d q_r}{d t} = - A_e q_r (1 - S)
\]

where:
- \( A_e \) = evaporation coefficient (depends on temperature, humidity, and droplet size)
- \( S \) = saturation ratio of the air

Rain evaporates more efficiently in drier air (\( S < 1 \)).

---

## 5. Rain Fallout (Precipitation Removal)
Rainwater that reaches a certain threshold is removed from the atmosphere as precipitation:

\[
\frac{d q_r}{d t} = - \frac{q_r}{\tau}
\]

where:
- \( \tau \) = rain fallout timescale (depends on raindrop terminal velocity and atmospheric depth)

This term accounts for the gravitational settling of raindrops and their removal from the system.

---

## Summary of Kessler Microphysics Equations

| Process           | Equation |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Cloud formation** | \( \frac{d q_c}{d t} = \max(0, S - 1) \cdot C_c \) |
| **Autoconversion** | \( \frac{d q_r}{d t} = A_c (q_c - q_{c0}) \) for \( q_c > q_{c0} \) |
| **Accretion** | \( \frac{d q_r}{d t} = A_a q_c q_r \) |
| **Evaporation** | \( \frac{d q_r}{d t} = - A_e q_r (1 - S) \) |
| **Rain fallout** | \( \frac{d q_r}{d t} = - \frac{q_r}{\tau} \) |

---

## Why These Equations Matter for Climate Modeling
- **Computational Efficiency**: These equations are simple and avoid expensive calculations related to detailed microphysics.
- **Basic Representation of Precipitation**: Provides a foundational model for cloud and rain processes in early climate models.
- **Limitations**: The scheme does not include ice-phase processes (snow, graupel), aerosol effects, or detailed spectral distributions of cloud droplets.

Azure: Help me :  Deeply understand the prognostic equations for water vapor (( q_v )), cloud water (( q_c )), and rainwater (( q_r )) mixing ratios, and the parameterizations for microphysical processes (e.g., condensation, autoconversion, accretion, evaporation).

Certainly! Let's delve deeply into the prognostic equations for water vapor (( q_v )), cloud water (( q_c )), and rainwater (( q_r )) mixing ratios, as well as the parameterizations for the key microphysical processes in the Kessler microphysics scheme: condensation, autoconversion, accretion, and evaporation.

Understanding these equations requires a solid grasp of the fundamental principles governing atmospheric water content and the processes by which water changes phase in the atmosphere. We'll break down each equation and process step by step.
 
1. Overview of Mixing Ratios
 
Before diving into the equations, let's clarify what the mixing ratios represent:
Water Vapor Mixing Ratio (( q_v )): The mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air (( \text{kg of water vapor} / \text{kg of dry air} )).
Cloud Water Mixing Ratio (( q_c )): The mass of cloud (liquid) water droplets per unit mass of dry air.
Rainwater Mixing Ratio (( q_r )): The mass of rainwater (liquid droplets large enough to fall as precipitation) per unit mass of dry air.
 
2. Prognostic Equations
 
Prognostic equations describe how these mixing ratios change over time due to various physical processes. They are derived from the conservation of mass for each water category.
2.1. General Form
 
For a scalar quantity ( q ), the prognostic equation in an atmospheric model can be written as:

[
\frac{D q}{D t} = S_q - L_q + T_q
]
( \frac{D q}{D t} ): Total (material) derivative of ( q ), representing the rate of change following an air parcel.
( S_q ): Sources of ( q ).
( L_q ): Losses of ( q ).
( T_q ): Transport terms (advection, diffusion).

In our context, we'll focus on the microphysical source and sink terms and consider transport implicitly included or addressed separately.
 
2.2. Water Vapor Mixing Ratio Equation (( q_v ))
 
[
\frac{D q_v}{D t} = - C + E_e
]
( C ): Condensation rate (conversion of water vapor to cloud water).
( E_e ): Evaporation of cloud water and rainwater back to water vapor.

Explanation:
Condensation (( -C )): Reduces ( q_v ) as water vapor condenses into cloud droplets.
Evaporation (( E_e )): Increases ( q_v ) as cloud water or rainwater evaporates back into vapor.
 
2.3. Cloud Water Mixing Ratio Equation (( q_c ))
 
[
\frac{D q_c}{D t} = C - A - \text{Coag}_c + E_c
]
( C ): Condensation rate (from water vapor to cloud water).
( A ): Autoconversion rate (cloud water converting to rainwater).
( \text{Coag}_c ): Collection (accretion) of cloud water by rainwater.
( E_c ): Evaporation of cloud water.

Explanation:
Condensation (( C )): Increases ( q_c ) as vapor condenses into cloud droplets.
Autoconversion (( -A )): Decreases ( q_c ) as cloud droplets coalesce into larger raindrops.
Accretion (( -\text{Coag}_c )): Decreases ( q_c ) as existing raindrops collect cloud droplets while falling.
Evaporation (( E_c )): Increases ( q_c ) when cloud droplets evaporate (but typically ( E_c ) is considered zero unless subsaturated conditions occur within clouds).
 
2.4. Rainwater Mixing Ratio Equation (( q_r ))
 
[
\frac{D q_r}{D t} + \frac{\partial (V_t q_r)}{\partial z} = A + \text{Coag}_c - E_r
]
( V_t ): Terminal fall velocity of raindrops.
( A ): Autoconversion rate (cloud water to rainwater).
( \text{Coag}_c ): Accretion rate (collection of cloud water by rainwater).
( E_r ): Evaporation of rainwater.

Explanation:
Autoconversion (( A )): Increases ( q_r ) as cloud droplets coalesce into raindrops.
Accretion (( \text{Coag}_c )): Increases ( q_r ) as raindrops collect additional cloud water.
Evaporation (( -E_r )): Decreases ( q_r ) as raindrops evaporate while falling through unsaturated air.
Sedimentation Term (( \frac{\partial (V_t q_r)}{\partial z} )): Represents the vertical transport of rainwater due to gravitational settling.
 
3. Microphysical Processes Parameterizations
 
Let's examine each microphysical process in detail.
3.1. Condensation and Evaporation (( C ) and ( E_e ))
 
a. Condensation (( C ))
 
Occurs when air becomes supersaturated (( q_v > q_{vs} )), leading to the formation of cloud droplets.

The rate of condensation is often modeled using a saturation adjustment approach:

[
C = \frac{q_v - q_{vs}}{\Delta t_s}, \quad \text{if } q_v > q_{vs}
]
( q_{vs} ): Saturation mixing ratio of water vapor over liquid water.
( \Delta t_s ): Time scale for saturation adjustment (often small, representing fast condensation).

In practice, condensation is assumed to occur instantaneously, adjusting ( q_v ) to ( q_{vs} ) and transferring the excess vapor to ( q_c ).
b. Evaporation (( E_e ))
 
Occurs when air is subsaturated (( q_v < q_{vs} )), causing cloud droplets or raindrops to evaporate.

The evaporation of cloud water is typically much slower than condensation and is often neglected unless modeling detailed cloud dissipation.
 
3.2. Autoconversion (( A ))
 
Represents the process by which cloud droplets collide and coalesce to form raindrops.

Parameterization:

[
A = \left{
\begin{array}{ll}
K_{ac} (q_c - q_{c0}), & q_c > q_{c0} \
0, & q_c \leq q_{c0}
\end{array}
\right.
]
( K_{ac} ): Autoconversion rate coefficient (( \text{s}^{-1} )).
( q_{c0} ): Threshold cloud water mixing ratio above which autoconversion begins.

Explanation:
When ( q_c ) exceeds ( q_{c0} ), autoconversion starts, representing the onset of precipitation formation.
The rate increases linearly with the excess cloud water above the threshold.

Physical Basis:
The threshold ( q_{c0} ) reflects the concept that a sufficient concentration of cloud droplets is needed before significant coalescence can occur.
( K_{ac} ) embodies the efficiency of the collision-coalescence process.
 
3.3. Accretion (( \text{Coag}_c ))
 
Describes how raindrops grow by collecting additional cloud droplets as they fall.

Parameterization:

[
\text{Coag}c = K{accr} q_c q_r
]
( K_{accr} ): Accretion coefficient (( \text{m}^3, \text{kg}^{-1}, \text{s}^{-1} )).

Explanation:
The rate depends on the product of cloud water and rainwater mixing ratios, representing the probability of collisions between raindrops and cloud droplets.
Accretion becomes significant when both ( q_c ) and ( q_r ) are non-negligible.

Physical Basis:
As raindrops descend, they sweep out a volume of air, collecting cloud droplets within that volume.
Larger raindrops and higher cloud water content increase the accretion rate.
 
3.4. Evaporation of Rainwater (( E_r ))
 
Represents the evaporation of raindrops as they fall through subsaturated air below the cloud base.

Parameterization:

[
E_r = K_{evap} (q_{vs} - q_v) q_r
]
( K_{evap} ): Evaporation rate coefficient (( \text{s}^{-1} )).
( q_{vs} - q_v ): Saturation deficit; positive when air is subsaturated.

Explanation:
Evaporation rate increases with larger saturation deficits and higher rainwater content.
Only occurs when ( q_v < q_{vs} ) (i.e., relative humidity less than 100%).

Physical Basis:
In dry air, raindrops evaporate more quickly, reducing ( q_r ) and increasing ( q_v ).
This process can lead to phenomena like virga, where precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground.
 
4. Detailed Examination of Each Equation
 
Let's delve deeper into each prognostic equation, combining the processes and their parameterizations.
4.1. Water Vapor Mixing Ratio (( q_v ))
 
[
\frac{D q_v}{D t} = - C + E_r + E_c
]

Terms Explained:
( -C ): Reduction in ( q_v ) due to condensation.
( E_r + E_c ): Increase in ( q_v ) due to evaporation of rainwater (( E_r )) and cloud water (( E_c )).

In Practice:
Often, ( E_c ) (evaporation of cloud water) is small or neglected, assuming cloud evaporation is slow or occurs under specific conditions.
Focus is on condensation and evaporation of rainwater.
 
4.2. Cloud Water Mixing Ratio (( q_c ))
 
[
\frac{D q_c}{D t} = C - A - \text{Coag}_c
]

Terms Explained:
( C ): Increase in ( q_c ) from condensation of water vapor.
( -A ): Decrease in ( q_c ) due to autoconversion to rainwater.
( -\text{Coag}_c ): Decrease in ( q_c ) due to accretion by falling raindrops.

Dynamics:
( q_c ) increases when condensation dominates (e.g., rising air, cooling).
( q_c ) decreases when precipitation processes (autoconversion, accretion) remove cloud water.
The balance of these terms determines cloud longevity and precipitation potential.
 
4.3. Rainwater Mixing Ratio (( q_r ))
 
[
\frac{D q_r}{D t} + \frac{\partial (V_t q_r)}{\partial z} = A + \text{Coag}_c - E_r
]

Terms Explained:
( A ): Increase in ( q_r ) from autoconversion of cloud water.
( \text{Coag}_c ): Increase in ( q_r ) from accretion of cloud water by rainwater.
( -E_r ): Decrease in ( q_r ) from evaporation of rainwater.
( \frac{\partial (V_t q_r)}{\partial z} ): Represents the vertical transport (falling) of rainwater.

Sedimentation Term Details:
( V_t ): Terminal fall velocity, typically parameterized as:
[
V_t = V_{t0} (q_r/q_{r0})^\beta
]
( V_{t0} ): Reference terminal velocity.
( q_{r0} ): Reference rainwater mixing ratio.
( \beta ): Exponent determining how fall speed varies with ( q_r ).
Assumptions:
In practice, ( V_t ) may be approximated as a constant average value for simplicity.
 
5. Physical Interpretation and Interactions
 
Understanding how these processes interact is crucial.
5.1. Cloud Formation and Growth
 
Initial Condensation (( C )):
As air rises and cools, ( q_v ) may exceed ( q_{vs} ), leading to condensation and cloud formation.
Cloud water content (( q_c )) increases, representing cloud growth.
5.2. Transition to Precipitation
 
Autoconversion (( A )):
When ( q_c ) exceeds ( q_{c0} ), small droplets begin to coalesce into larger raindrops.
The autoconversion rate (( A )) increases with excess cloud water.
Initiates the formation of precipitation-sized particles.
Accretion (( \text{Coag}_c )):
Once rainwater (( q_r )) is present, accretion becomes significant.
Raindrops grow by collecting cloud droplets, enhancing ( q_r ) and diminishing ( q_c ).
5.3. Precipitation Falling and Evaporation
 
Sedimentation:
Raindrops fall due to gravity, represented by the sedimentation term.
The flux of rainwater downward (( V_t q_r )) affects vertical profiles of ( q_r ).
Evaporation of Rainwater (( E_r )):
As raindrops fall through subsaturated air, they may evaporate.
Decreases ( q_r ) and increases ( q_v ) at lower levels.
Can affect surface precipitation rates.
 
6. Mathematical Expressions of Parameterizations
 
Let's revisit and provide explicit forms for the parameterizations.
6.1. Saturation Mixing Ratio (( q_{vs} ))
 
The saturation mixing ratio over liquid water is given by:

[
q_{vs} = 0.622 \frac{e_s}{p - e_s}
]
( e_s ): Saturation vapor pressure over liquid water (function of temperature).
( p ): Atmospheric pressure.

Clausius-Clapeyron Equation for ( e_s ):

[
e_s(T) = e_0 \exp\left( \frac{L_v (T - T_0)}{R_v T T_0} \right)
]
( e_0 ): Reference saturation vapor pressure at ( T_0 ).
( L_v ): Latent heat of vaporization.
( R_v ): Gas constant for water vapor.
( T ): Temperature.
 
6.2. Autoconversion Rate Coefficient (( K_{ac} ))
 
Empirical value, often around ( 1 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}^{-1} ).

Threshold Cloud Water (( q_{c0} )):
Represents the minimum ( q_c ) for autoconversion to occur.
Typical value: ( 1 \times 10^{-3} , \text{kg/kg} ).
 
6.3. Accretion Coefficient (( K_{accr} ))
 
Empirical value, around ( 2.2 , \text{m}^3, \text{kg}^{-1}, \text{s}^{-1} ).
Derived from collision efficiency and sweep-out volume of raindrops.
 
6.4. Evaporation Coefficient (( K_{evap} ))
 
Incorporates factors like ventilation effects and diffusion rates.
Can be complex; often simplified to an empirical value.
 
6.5. Terminal Fall Velocity (( V_t ))
 
Simplistic approach: Constant ( V_t ), e.g., ( 7 , \text{m/s} ).
Advanced parameterization:
[
V_t(q_r) = V_{t0} \left( \frac{q_r}{q_{r0}} \right)^\beta
]

Temperature (( T )): ( 293 , \text{K} )
Pressure (( p )): ( 1000 , \text{hPa} )
Water Vapor Mixing Ratio (( q_v )): ( 0.014 , \text{kg/kg} )
Cloud Water Mixing Ratio (( q_c )): ( 0.0015 , \text{kg/kg} )
Rainwater Mixing Ratio (( q_r )): ( 0.0002 , \text{kg/kg} )
Calculate Saturation Mixing Ratio (( q_{vs} )):
 
( e_s ) at ( 293 , \text{K} ):
Use the Tetens equation for ( e_s ) over liquid water:
[
e_s(T) = 6.112 \exp\left( \frac{17.67 (T - 273.15)}{T - 29.65} \right) , \text{hPa}
]
[
e_s(293) = 6.112 \exp\left( \frac{17.67 \times 20}{20 - 29.65} \right) = 23.36 , \text{hPa}
]
( q_{vs} ):
[
q_{vs} = 0.622 \frac{e_s}{p - e_s} = 0.622 \frac{23.36}{1000 - 23.36} \approx 0.0148 , \text{kg/kg}
]
Determine Condensation Rate (( C )):
 
Since ( q_v < q_{vs} ) (( 0.014 < 0.0148 )), no condensation occurs.
Possible evaporation of cloud water.
 
Calculate Autoconversion Rate (( A )):
 
Given ( q_c = 0.0015 , \text{kg/kg} ), ( q_{c0} = 0.001 , \text{kg/kg} ).

[
A = K_{ac} (q_c - q_{c0}) = 1 \times 10^{-3} (0.0015 - 0.001) = 5 \times 10^{-7} , \text{kg/kg/s}
]
 
Calculate Accretion Rate (( \text{Coag}_c )):
 
[
\text{Coag}c = K{accr} q_c q_r = 2.2 (0.0015)(0.0002) = 6.6 \times 10^{-7} , \text{kg/kg/s}
]
 
Calculate Evaporation of Rainwater (( E_r )):
 
Since ( q_v < q_{vs} ), evaporation can occur.

[
E_r = K_{evap} (q_{vs} - q_v) q_r
]
Assuming ( K_{evap} = 1 , \text{s}^{-1} ) for simplicity.

[
E_r = 1 (0.0148 - 0.0140)(0.0002) = 1 (0.0008)(0.0002) = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} , \text{kg/kg/s}
]
 
Update Mixing Ratios
 
Rainwater Mixing Ratio (( q_r )):

[
\frac{D q_r}{D t} = A + \text{Coag}_c - E_r - \text{Sedimentation}
]

Ignoring sedimentation for the moment, total rate of change:

[
\frac{D q_r}{D t} = (5 \times 10^{-7}) + (6.6 \times 10^{-7}) - (1.6 \times 10^{-7}) = 1 \times 10^{-6} , \text{kg/kg/s}
]

Cloud Water Mixing Ratio (( q_c )):

[
\frac{D q_c}{D t} = -A - \text{Coag}_c
]

[
\frac{D q_c}{D t} = -(5 \times 10^{-7}) - (6.6 \times 10^{-7}) = -1.16 \times 10^{-6} , \text{kg/kg/s}
]

Water Vapor Mixing Ratio (( q_v )):

[
\frac{D q_v}{D t} = E_r
]

[
\frac{D q_v}{D t} = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} , \text{kg/kg/s}
]
 
Interpretation
 
( q_r ) is increasing due to autoconversion and accretion, indicating growth of raindrops.
( q_c ) is decreasing as cloud water is converted to rainwater.
( q_v ) is slightly increasing due to evaporation of raindrops.
 
8. Incorporating Sedimentation
 
The sedimentation term (( \frac{\partial (V_t q_r)}{\partial z} )) represents the vertical transport of rainwater due to gravity.

Discrete Approximation:
In numerical models, sedimentation is treated using finite differences or specific algorithms (e.g., flux-limiters) to ensure numerical stability.
For our example, suppose ( V_t = 7 , \text{m/s} ), and we have a vertical grid spacing (( \Delta z )).

Rate of Change Due to Sedimentation:

[
\text{Sedimentation Rate} = \frac{V_t q_r}{\Delta z}
]
This term would subtract from ( q_r ) at the current level and add to ( q_r ) at the level below.
 
9. Physical Constraints and Conservation
 
Mass Conservation: The total mass of water substance (( q_v + q_c + q_r )) should be conserved except for sources/sinks (e.g., surface evaporation, precipitation reaching the ground).
Non-Negativity: Mixing ratios must remain non-negative. Negative values are physically meaningless and can cause numerical instability.
